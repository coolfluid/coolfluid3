  class ListeningInfo;

  /// @brief Listener for MPI messages.

  /// This class has been designed to be used as a Boost thread. When it is
  /// running, it continuously listens to one or more  MPI intercommunicators.
  /// If there are more than one intercommunicator, all of them are listened
  /// simultanuously. The thread is started by calling @c start_listening()
  /// and stopped with @c stop_listening. A thread cannot be started if
  /// it is already running. It is not recommended to have an communicator
  /// to be listened by two threads at the same time as the behaviour can
  /// be undefined. @n

  /// Internally, the thread makes a non-blocking MPI receive on all
  /// communicators and then sleeps during some time (defined by the user).
  /// When it wakes up, it checks all the communicators and, for each of them
  /// that has new data, calls the @c new_signal signal; and then makes a new
  /// non-blocking receive. @n

  /// The fact that the thread sleeps is for performance reasons: it is to
  /// avoid the code to run useless instruction and use not needed CPU time
  /// while waiting. It is to the user to determine the best "sleeping time".
  /// The default is 10 milliseconds. @n

  /// However, be careful when defining this sleeping time. The biggest it is,
  /// the longuest is the response time for requests. If the sleeping time is too
  /// small, the CPU usage might be too high if no data arrives during a long time. @n

  /// New intercommunicators can be added on the run as well as the sleeping
  /// time can be modified. Thoes changes will be taken into account
  /// at the next iteration (after the next check).
